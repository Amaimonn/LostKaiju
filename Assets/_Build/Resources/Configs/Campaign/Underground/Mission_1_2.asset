  <Text>k__BackingField: "Deeper. Darker. Quieter. You descend further, to a place
    where light no longer reaches, and only the faint glimmer of your own presence
    illuminates the path. Here, in this endless void, the ground is no longer beneath
    your feet. Instead, there are only scattered islands of solid surface, floating
    in the darkness like fragments of a forgotten world.\r\n\r\nJumps. They become
    the only way forward. Each one is a leap into the unknown. Below you lies the
    abyss \u2014 black and bottomless, like death itself. It doesn\u2019t just wait
    \u2014 it breathes, shifts, as if alive. Sometimes, it feels as though it\u2019s
    calling to you, luring you, promising an end to all your doubts and fears. But
    you know: one misstep, and you\u2019ll vanish into it forever."
