  <Name>k__BackingField: Laws of gravity
  <Text>k__BackingField: "Between the rooftops, where streets once lay, there is
    now only emptiness. But this emptiness is not dead \u2014 it is alive, breathing.
    Within it hover fragments of something vast, something important, that once collapsed
    and now hangs suspended in the air, as if time itself decided to halt their fall.
    These platforms, cracked and marked by the scars of long-forgotten disasters,
    seem both fragile and eternal. They defy gravity, as if challenging the very
    laws of this world. It feels as though they are waiting\u2014waiting for someone
    to step onto them and continue a journey that was interrupted so long ago."
