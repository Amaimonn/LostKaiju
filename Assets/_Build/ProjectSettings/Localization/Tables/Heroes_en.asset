    m_Localized: "Quiet and enigmatic, Lost seems adrift in this world\u2014yet that
      very quality makes him unpredictable. He seeks neither power nor destruction,
      simply walking his own path as if following a call only he can hear. His eyes
      hold a deep, almost melancholic resolve."

    m_Localized: "Sad yet deeply caring, Azure carries the weight of the world in
      his silent gaze. He observes, calculates, and intervenes only when necessary\u2014but
      when he does, it's always to protect. There's a quiet sorrow in his wisdom,
      as if he's seen too much yet still chooses to shield others from the same pain."

    m_Localized: "A storm given flesh, Orif burns with unchecked fury. He doesn\u2019t
      fight for causes or ideals\u2014he fights because rage is the only language
      left to him. There\u2019s no subtlety in his violence, only the raw, screaming
      truth of a creature that refuses to be broken."

    m_Localized: "Dark and inscrutable, Noctis is like a living shadow. He rarely
      appears, but when he does, an oppressive silence follows. His motives are unclear,
      his actions seem illogical\u2014yet there\u2019s something terrifyingly deliberate
      in every move he makes."

    m_Localized: "Yellorie laughs where others weep. Jokes when the rest fall silent
      in horror. His words are honed blades, his sarcasm\u2014a shield against the
      world\u2019s absurdity. He won\u2019t risk his hide for some \"noble cause,\"
      but let him see the strong prey on the weak\u2014oh, then you\u2019ll see it.
      A cold fire ignites behind those yellow eyes."
